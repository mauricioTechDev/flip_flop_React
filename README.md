# âœ… Flip-Flop-App A Full Stack React Application
## This app that allows you to share your photos with other.  You can save friends to your profile and keep up with all the cool pictures they put up.  


For this project I wanted to focus on using PostgreSQL for my database and on Schema Management/Database Architecture.  I also used S3 for image storage. In the back end I am running  Express with Node.js with a React front end.  Where I focused on using Hooks to manage my state and composability of functionality. ðŸš€
